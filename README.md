# play-modsecurity


## What is this?
It is for learning web security through modsecurity, which is a WAF tools.

This works with modsecurity and insecure app.

Therefore, you can try to protect against vulnerabilities by setting modsecurity rules.

## How To Set Up

### Run Containers
Type below command so that you can run container.(It takes 10 min .)

### Restart Nginx Server
After running containers, you need to restart nginx server(including modsecurity) so that it

can integrate with WebGoat.

To enter and restart nginx server including modsecurity, you type some commands.

Commands are as follows.

`docker exec -it modsec bash`

`/etc/init.d/nginx restart`

Then you can access the Webgoat via below URL. (please wait 30sec after typing above commands.)

`http://localhost/WebGoat`

## How To Change Rules

If you want to change modsecurity rule, you needs to update `./conf.d/ruleset.con` .

then, you will restart nginx server as I explained previously.
